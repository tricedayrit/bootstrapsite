        Welcome to my website! I am Beatrice Dayrit: college student, artist, barista, and writer.
        <br></br>
        Originally from Bend, Oregon, I moved to Idaho to attend Boise State under the GIMM
        program. As of April 2020, my projected graduation date is in May 2022.
        <br></br>
        Through college, I've been working at Dutch Brothers, modeling, painting, and woodburning
        for fun and to earn some extra cash. Through the Great Quarantine of 2020, I took up woodworking and
        sculpting.
        <br></br>
        I have a little brother whom I adore. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and swimming.
        I've also enjoyed coding since high school, and have been working with bootstrap since I was
        fourteen.
        <br>
        If I'm not in the mountains or in a river, I'm usually in front of my computer writing. I'm currently
        working for fun on a textbook-style guide to Skyrim trivia. I also enjoy writing works of fiction
        as well as posting to forums about Star Wars and MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) discourse.

          I entered the workforce at seventeen when I was hired at a candy company, Goody's. I remained with

        <h5 class="card-title">Pokemon Trainer Mai</h5>
        <p class="card-text">This was a gift to a friend, Elly, for her birthday. She wanted to see her character from a video
        game as a Pokemon trainer, complete with Pokemon of her choosing. I had tons of fun designing the character and creating
        an outfit for a Pokemon trainer-- the Pokeverse has some crazy outfits! Unfortunately, I had trouble with composition and
        anatomy, but by the end of the day I ended up having a great time designing it.I used Photoshop to complete everything
        in this piece. This was also my first venture into moving art; while I didn't personally animate the gifs used, I realized
      how nice it looked when there was a little something extra going on.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Always Find You</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The same video game character Mai is a time traveler according to the game lore. She's a superhero
      of sorts, and here she is pictured traveling through time to save her ally from falling into Hell. This is my favorite piece I've done.
    Originally, the colors for the wisps coming off her were yellow, but I used the hue filter on Photoshop to change the colors into
    something softer. This is also the piece where I learned to draw hands and lighting; paying special attention to the bottom, there were tons of
  hand references I needed to figure out. It was frustrating, but I believe the payoff was worth it.</p>

        did not have a reliable brush stabiliser when I first began working with it. I used Paint Tool SAI for this piece and had a blast with the
      brush textures, as evidenced by the scratchy pencil quality of the </p>
