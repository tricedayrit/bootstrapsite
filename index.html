      <tabcontent>
        Welcome to my website! I am Beatrice Dayrit: college student, artist, barista, and writer.
        <br></br>
        Originally from Bend, Oregon, I moved to Idaho to attend Boise State under the GIMM
        program. As of April 2020, my projected graduation date is in May 2022.
        <br></br>
        Through college, I've been working at Dutch Brothers, modeling, painting, and woodburning
        for fun and to earn some extra cash. Through the Great Quarantine of 2020, I took up woodworking and
        sculpting.
        <br></br>
        I have a little brother whom I adore. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and swimming.
        I've also enjoyed coding since high school, and have been working with bootstrap since I was
        fourteen.
        <br>
        If I'm not in the mountains or in a river, I'm usually in front of my computer writing. I'm currently
        working for fun on a textbook-style guide to Skyrim trivia. I also enjoy writing works of fiction
        as well as posting to forums about Star Wars and MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) discourse.

          I am a digital artist. I work in Photoshop CC 2019 and draw with a Wacom Intuos 2016. My favorite

      <br></br>
      <tabcontent>
          I entered the workforce at seventeen when I was hired at a candy company, Goody's. I remained with
          Goody's for two years as a shift lead until I went to college, and I then began work at Dutch Bros coffee.

        <h5 class="card-title">Pokemon Trainer Mai</h5>
        <p class="card-text">This was a gift to a friend, Elly, for her birthday. She wanted to see her character from a video
        game as a Pokemon trainer, complete with Pokemon of her choosing. I had tons of fun designing the character and creating
        an outfit for a Pokemon trainer-- the Pokeverse has some crazy outfits! Unfortunately, I had trouble with composition and
        anatomy, but by the end of the day I ended up having a great time designing it.I used Photoshop to complete everything
        in this piece. This was also my first venture into moving art; while I didn't personally animate the gifs used, I realized
      how nice it looked when there was a little something extra going on.</p>

    her best friend.">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Always Find You</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The same video game character Mai is a time traveler according to the game lore. She's a superhero
      of sorts, and here she is pictured traveling through time to save her ally from falling into Hell. This is my favorite piece I've done.
    Originally, the colors for the wisps coming off her were yellow, but I used the hue filter on Photoshop to change the colors into
    something softer. This is also the piece where I learned to draw hands and lighting; paying special attention to the bottom, there were tons of
  hand references I needed to figure out. It was frustrating, but I believe the payoff was worth it.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Lucien</h5>
        <p class="card-text">This is the first piece I ever did as a digital artist. I actually didn't use Photoshop for this piece, as Photoshop
        did not have a reliable brush stabiliser when I first began working with it. I used Paint Tool SAI for this piece and had a blast with the
      brush textures, as evidenced by the scratchy pencil quality of the lines and the watercolor background texture.</p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">The Getaway</h5>
      <p class="card-text">This was a Christmas present for my friend Lou. This was the first piece I animated on my own; while
      it's not very intricate, I had thought at the time it was the best thing I'd ever done. At this time, I was still using
    Paint Tool SAI. After using the Timeline and frames to animate the coins in Photoshop, I made the switch.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">What-If</h5>
        <p class="card-text">I personally hated The Rise of Skywalker, but I'll admit that there seemed to be a really weird chemistry between
        Kylo Ren and Rey after it. This piece explores what could've happened after. This is probably the most advanced piece I've ever done,
      since the hair, eyes, lips, trees, waterfalls, and sky are all animated. I hand-animated this frame-by-frame in Photoshop.</p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Stolen Moments</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Like most of my pieces, this was commissioned by a friend of mine, Thea. It features Kylo Ren and Rey if Rey
      were secretly long-lost royalty. My goal for this piece was to challenge color scheme; purple and dark colors are traditionally not
      considered colors that evoke warmth, so I attempted it through expression. I'm personally proud of the expressions of the characters
      in this piece. Further, the stars in the background were the first smooth animations I'd done in an art piece.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">The Dark Side</h5>
        <p class="card-text">This is how I did want The Rise of Skywalker to go. The trailers of Dark Rey that Lucasfilms dropped in the
        months before the movie's release made me think that she would turn to the dark side, Kylo Ren would turn to the light side, and
        she would kill him. The lighting was so much fun, as well as coming up with a new technique I'd never done before to draw the
        lightsabers. What I'm personally proud of is the look in Rey's eyes as she realizes what she's about to do, and the exploding
        legacy saber. I had a blast (no pun intended) with the composition.</p>

      However, I am particularly proud of the detail in this linework, and intend to finish it once the commissioner finishes payment.</p>
